## Spring Boot Example
### Purpose
Just a quick check of the processes in getting a Spring Boot app up running and pushed to gitHub via IntelliJ.

### How
Used [Spring Initilizer](https://start.spring.io/) to create a simple app, could have used a maven archetype, or just done it all by hand.

### Add in some REST
The next plan is to add in some simple REST and then maybe employ CockroachDb to try that out.
